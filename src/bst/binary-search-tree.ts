/**
 * At most 2 child nodes, left and right.
 * Left child will always have a lower value compared to parent.
 * Right child will always have a higher value compared to parent.
 * Same rules apply for subtrees.
 * These properties will make search operations faster when the data is organized into a Binary Search Tree.
 * Smaller values will always be in the left subtree and the larger values will always be in the right subtree.
